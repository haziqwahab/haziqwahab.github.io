## What Massachusetts' Education Data Tells Us About Graduation Rates

#### Software : Tableau

When I first started analysing education data, I was surprised by the staggering number of students who didn't graduate. Over **162,000** young people in **Massachusetts** faced this reality, while more than **791,000** successfully completed their high school journey. These numbers made me reflect deeply

### Why THIS Project?

I was driven to tackle this project because I truly believe that **education is one of the most powerful steps toward a better future**. I wanted to understand how different elements, like **class size** and the **economic background** of students, influence graduation rates. This project felt personal to me not only because I cherish education, but because I want to contribute to **meaningful changes** that can help students succeed.


### What Readers Will Gain

In reading this article, I hope you'll gain insights into the **graduation landscape in Massachusetts**. You’ll learn about the **surprising statistics** surrounding graduates and dropouts, how **economic factors** play a role, and what **schools are excelling or struggling**. I'll also share my thoughts on why we see these patterns and what they might mean for the **future of education**.


### Key Takeaways

- Over **162,137** students in Massachusetts did not graduate last year.
- The **top five schools** in graduation rates have far fewer economically disadvantaged students **(average of 13%)**.
- An average class size of 18 might **not significantly impact** student success.


### Dataset Details

The data I analysed came directly from the **Massachusetts Department of Education** for the year 2017. It included critical details about **graduation rates, attendance, and average class sizes**. This dataset was particularly suitable because it allowed for a comprehensive view of the challenges faced by students across the state.

### Visuals and Insights

I've identified schools like Springfield Public, Boston Charter, Whaling City Junior, Springfield High, and Phoenix Academy that are struggling with their grade point averages. These schools **could benefit from tutoring programs for academic support**, mentorship opportunities, and access to teaching materials and technology. Additionally, professional development for teachers and community engagement can create a supportive environment. Focusing on these areas **can help improve their academic performance**.

The **average class size across the state is 18**, but interestingly, the **top 5 schools have larger class sizes**. This suggests that class size may not play a significant role in student grades. However, there’s still more data to consider.

One striking visual showed that **schools with the lowest graduation** rates had an **average of 77% economically disadvantaged students**. This raised questions about the support systems in place for these students compared to those in more affluent schools.

The top five districts in fourth-grade math proficiency have **surpassed the average passing threshold of 50%**. It will be important to reach out to these schools within the districts to understand how they are supporting their students' success.

### Main Takeaways

In summary, the analysis highlighted some key aspects of education in Massachusetts that require attention:

- A significant number of students are not graduating, indicating a **need for targeted support**.
- Schools serving **economically disadvantaged** students often show **lower graduation rates**.
- Investigating the practices at the top-performing schools could provide valuable lessons to **help struggling schools improve**.


### Conclusion and Personal Reflections

This project was eye-opening for me. It reminded me that behind every statistic are real students and families who are affected by these challenges. I faced difficulties with data organisation but learned the importance of patience and thoroughness. I feel more motivated than ever to advocate for changes that can help improve education for all.
