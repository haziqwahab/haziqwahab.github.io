### Why THIS Project?

I was driven to tackle this project because I truly believe that **education is one of the most powerful steps toward a better future**. I wanted to understand how different elements, like **class size** and the **economic background** of students, influence graduation rates. This project felt personal to me not only because I cherish education, but because I want to contribute to **meaningful changes** that can help students succeed.


### What Readers Will Gain

In reading this article, I hope you'll gain insights into the **graduation landscape in Massachusetts**. You’ll learn about the **surprising statistics** surrounding graduates and dropouts, how **economic factors** play a role, and what **schools are excelling or struggling**. I'll also share my thoughts on why we see these patterns and what they might mean for the **future of education**.


### Key Takeaways

- Over **162,137** students in Massachusetts did not graduate last year.
- The **top five schools** in graduation rates have far fewer economically disadvantaged students **(average of 13%)**.
- An average class size of 18 might **not significantly impact** student success.


### Dataset Details

The data I analysed came directly from the **Massachusetts Department of Education** for the year 2017. It included critical details about **graduation rates, attendance, and average class sizes**. This dataset was particularly suitable because it allowed for a comprehensive view of the challenges faced by students across the state.

### Visuals and Insights

#### Campaign 6 Performance vs. General Customer Base

The analysis shows that while Campaign 6 attracted fewer customers (311), they spent 63% more on average compared to the general customer base. This indicates an opportunity for businesses to convert more customers to this higher-spending model

The chart shows customer acquisition peaks in **January**, **March**, **July**, and **August**, likely due to effective campaigns or seasonal trends. In contrast, **November** and **December** have the lowest numbers, suggesting room for improved engagement. Mid-year months show steady growth. Overall, the data highlights key periods of success and opportunities for targeted improvements.

#### Income vs. Total Spent (Scatter Plot)

This scatter plot shows a strong positive correlation **(R² = 0.67)** between customer income and spending. It confirms that higher-income customers are more likely to spend more. For businesses, this means marketing efforts should focus on individuals with incomes above $60,000, who are likely to contribute more revenue.

#### Histogram Analysis: Customer Spending Distribution

The histogram reveals a steep drop-off in customer spending. Most customers spend between $4 and $833, with only a small fraction reaching higher tiers. This shows that while many customers make frequent orders, a select few drive most of the revenue. A focus on encouraging moderate spenders to increase their order sizes could be beneficial.

#### Customer Spending by Number of Children Analysis

I found that child-free customers tend to spend five times more than parents. With 207 child-free customers and a total spending of $260,428, it’s clear they form a premium segment worth targeting. This insight suggests that marketing campaigns could be tailored specifically to appeal to these customers.

### Main Takeaways:

- **Campaign 6 Works** – It successfully attracts customers who spend significantly more.
- **Untapped Potential** – With only 15% of customers responding, there’s considerable opportunity to engage a larger audience.
- **Data-Driven Strategy** – Understanding income and family status can help in targeting the right customers more effectively.
- **Quick Wins Available** – Small changes, like offering VIP perks for top spenders, could quickly enhance revenue.

### Conclusion and Personal Reflections:

This analysis taught me a lot about the importance of data in driving business decisions. One challenge I faced was determining which visualisations would best convey my findings, but with some trial and error, I found ways to make the data clear and engaging. This project has shifted my perspective on how businesses can utilise customer data to refine their marketing strategies. I’m excited to see how these insights can be applied in future projects.
