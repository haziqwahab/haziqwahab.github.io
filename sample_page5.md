## 101,000 Voices: What SQL Reveals About Healthcare Operations
#### Software : SQL

When I started my project analysing healthcare data, I thought I was just crunching numbers. Little did I know, I was about to stumble into a treasure trove of insights that could shape how we understand hospital operations. Imagine revealing that patients are often discharged in less than a week or exploring the fascinating world of medical specialties and their volume of procedures. This journey turned out to be an eye-opener for me.

### Why THIS Project?

Healthcare has always held a special place in my heart. It's not just about numbers it's about people and how we can improve their lives. With a significant portion of national budgets allocated to healthcare, I felt compelled to dig deeper into hospital performance. This project was my way of contributing by studying how hospitals operate and preparing for future challenges based on solid data.

### What Readers Will Gain

Through this article, you will gain insights into hospital readmission trends, understand the average length of stays, and discover how different medical specialties perform. You'll also learn about patient treatment fairness across races and the relationship between the number of lab procedures and hospital stays.

### Key Takeaways

- Most patients are discharged within an average of **4.4 days**.

- **Cardiology and related surgeries** are the most common hospital procedures.

- **Race does not influence** the administration of lab procedures in hospitals.

- A **higher number of lab procedures** is associated with **longer hospital stays**.

- Patients prescribed **numerous medications** are **less likely to be readmitted**.

### Dataset Details

For this project, I used a dataset sourced from Kaggle, which contains information about diabetes patients from 130 US hospitals between 1999 and 2008. This dataset was perfect for my analysis as it included patient demographics, health history, hospital usage metrics, and outcomes related to readmission risk.

The origin of the data can be found [here]([https://www.kaggle.com/code/iabhishekofficial/prediction-on-hospital-readmission/notebook](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2022_totals.html)).
