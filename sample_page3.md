## Unpacking IDA Loans: Insights from the World Bank Data
#### Software : SQL

When I first delved into the world of international loans, I had no idea how surprising the insights could be. Picture this: huge sums of money being lent to countries all around the globe, each transaction telling a story of development, struggle, and hope. This project allowed me to explore this world through data from the World Bank, focusing on their International Development Association (IDA) credits and grants.

### Why THIS Project?

My motivation for this project stemmed from a personal interest in understanding how financial support from the World Bank affects countries in need. The IDA plays a crucial role in providing low-interest loans and grants to countries that require assistance in developing their infrastructure and economies. I wanted to see who benefits from this system and how effectively the funds are being used. Diving into this data felt like peeling back the layers of a complex puzzle, and I was eager to see what I would find.

### Dataset Details

For this project, I used a dataset sourced from the World Bank, specifically focusing on the IDA's credits and grants as of November 2022. This data provided a clear snapshot of the borrowing landscape across various countries. It was crucial to ensure that the data was both comprehensive and representative of the trends I wanted to explore.

### Analysis Process & Key Insights

I began my analysis by **cleaning the data** to ensure accuracy, then moved on to **querying it using SQL**. My queries focused on identifying patterns in **loan amounts**, **repayment rates**, and **transaction counts**.One surprising finding was the **high level of activity**—with **over 1 million transactions**, many countries showed a strong commitment to development through IDA loans. When I examined **Nicaragua**, I nearly fell off my chair at the total loan amount **nearly $85 billion**! This raised an important question in my mind:
