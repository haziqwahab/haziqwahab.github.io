## Unpacking IDA Loans: Insights from the World Bank Data
#### Software : SQL

When I first delved into the world of international loans, I had no idea how surprising the insights could be. Picture this: huge sums of money being lent to countries all around the globe, each transaction telling a story of development, struggle, and hope. This project allowed me to explore this world through data from the World Bank, focusing on their International Development Association (IDA) credits and grants.

### Why THIS Project?

My motivation for this project stemmed from a personal interest in understanding how financial support from the World Bank affects countries in need. The IDA plays a crucial role in providing low-interest loans and grants to countries that require assistance in developing their infrastructure and economies. I wanted to see who benefits from this system and how effectively the funds are being used. Diving into this data felt like peeling back the layers of a complex puzzle, and I was eager to see what I would find.


### What Readers Will Gain

As you read through this article, you’ll learn about the most significant loan recipients, the countries that are utilizing their loans effectively, and some surprising trends in the data. My hope is to provide you with insights that shed light on how international lending works and the importance of responsible borrowing and repayment.


### Key Takeaways

- **India** has the **highest debt** – over **$793 million** from **58,339 loans**.
- **Tanzania** is the **most recent country** to **repay its loans**.
- There are **over 1 million transactions**, showing strong global use of **IDA loans**.
- **Nicaragua** stands out with a **massive loan total** of nearly **$85 billion**.
- There’s a **big gap between top and low borrowers**, reflecting **varying development needs** across countries.

### Dataset Details

For this project, I used a dataset sourced from the World Bank, specifically focusing on the IDA's credits and grants as of November 2022. This data provided a clear snapshot of the borrowing landscape across various countries. It was crucial to ensure that the data was both comprehensive and representative of the trends I wanted to explore.

### Analysis Process & Key Insights

I began my analysis by **querying the data using SQL**. My queries focused on identifying patterns in **loan amounts**, **repayment rates**, and **transaction counts**.One surprising finding was the **high level of activity** with **over 1 million transactions**, many countries showed a strong commitment to development through IDA loans. When I examined **Nicaragua**, I nearly fell off my chair at the total loan amount **nearly $85 billion**! 

This raised an important question in my mind:  
**Should there be a cap on how much a single country can borrow?**
