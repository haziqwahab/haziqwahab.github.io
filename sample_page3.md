#### Software : SQL

When I first delved into the world of international loans, I had no idea how surprising the insights could be. Picture this: huge sums of money being lent to countries all around the globe, each transaction telling a story of development, struggle, and hope. This project allowed me to explore this world through data from the World Bank, focusing on their International Development Association (IDA) credits and grants.

### Why THIS Project?

My motivation for this project stemmed from a personal interest in understanding how financial support from the World Bank affects countries in need. The IDA plays a crucial role in providing low-interest loans and grants to countries that require assistance in developing their infrastructure and economies. I wanted to see who benefits from this system and how effectively the funds are being used. Diving into this data felt like peeling back the layers of a complex puzzle, and I was eager to see what I would find.
