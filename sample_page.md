## How DoorDash’s Promotions Can Turn Casual Customers into Loyal Fans

### Why THIS Project?

**Project description:** As someone who relies on food delivery due to my hectic schedule, I’ve always been fascinated by how food delivery companies run their promotional campaigns, especially since I often see them targeting new users with exciting discounts. My interest grew when I noticed that many of my friends and colleagues would use these promotions only to return to their old habits afterward. I wanted to find out if these campaigns truly make a lasting impact or just create a quick spike in orders. So, I decided to dig into the data and see what I could find.

In this article, you'll learn about the effectiveness of DoorDash's promotional strategies based on my analysis. I’ll share key insights about customer spending behaviors, the demographics that drive revenue, and how businesses can better target their marketing efforts based on what the data shows

### Key Takeaways:

-Campaign 6 drew in higher-value customers who spent 63% more than average.
-Only 15% of customers responded to this campaign, indicating there's room for growth.
-Higher-income customers are more likely to spend more, highlighting a target market.
-A small group of customers contributes significantly to total revenue, while the majority spend modestly.
