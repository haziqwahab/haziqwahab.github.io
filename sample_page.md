## How DoorDash’s Promotions Can Turn Casual Customers into Loyal Fans

### Why THIS Project?

As someone who relies on food delivery due to my hectic schedule, I’ve always been fascinated by how food delivery companies run their promotional campaigns, especially since I often see them targeting new users with exciting discounts. My interest grew when I noticed that many of my friends and colleagues would use these promotions only to return to their old habits afterward. I wanted to find out if these campaigns truly make a lasting impact or just create a quick spike in orders. So, I decided to dig into the data and see what I could find.

In this article, you'll learn about the effectiveness of DoorDash's promotional strategies based on my analysis. I’ll share key insights about customer spending behaviors, the demographics that drive revenue, and how businesses can better target their marketing efforts based on what the data shows

### Key Takeaways:

- **Campaign 6** drew in higher-value customers who spent **63% more** than average.
- Only **15%** of customers responded to this campaign, indicating there's room for growth.
- **Higher-income customers** are more likely to spend more, highlighting a target market.
- A **small group** of customers contributes significantly to total revenue, while the **majority spend modestly**.

### Dataset Details:

The dataset I analysed comes from a case study originally used in an iFood interview, which I found on GitHub. It contains 2,206 rows and 36 columns, detailing various customer attributes such as age, income, total spending, and registration dates. This dataset was perfect for my project as it provided a comprehensive view of customer behavior, allowing me to see how promotions influence their spending.

### Analysis Process:

I started by cleaning the dataset to remove any inconsistencies, ensuring the data was ready for analysis. Using Excel, I created various visualisations to uncover spending patterns and relationships. One surprising finding was that only 15% of customers engaged with Campaign 6, yet they drove such significant revenue. This led me to think about marketing strategies and how they could be adjusted to reach more customers effectively.
